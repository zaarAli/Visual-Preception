# Visual-Preception

## Description
This repository contains a collection of projects related to visual perception that I completed as part of my Masters in Computer Science. These projects cover fundamental principles of Computer Vision such as camera simulation and calibration, corner tracking, object recognition, and epipolar geometry. Each project is implemented using Python, and is accompanied by a detailed report explaining the theory, implementation, and results. 
## Projects (so far)

The projects included in this repository are:
1. Camera simulation and calibration using the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) method. <br>
2. Corner tracking using the Harris corner detector and brute force matching of intensity-based descriptors. <br>
3. Object recognition and image wrapping using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), and the Homography matrix <br>
4. Epipolar geometry and the 8-point algorithm for stereo reconstruction. <br>

This repository is intended for educational purposes and can serve as a resource for anyone interested in learning about Computer Vision and its applications.<br><br>
